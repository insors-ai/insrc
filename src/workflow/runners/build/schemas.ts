 * The `build` admission-gate verdict (sc3).

 * daemon owns at admission time is: is this Story's plan present, approved,
 * and fresh against its design.story? That question is answered by
 * `admitBuild` (see `admission.ts`), which returns the discriminated union

//     only, the inline drift hashes. `treeUntouched: true` is a STRUCTURAL
//     invariant: the gate is read-only and runs before any Task is touched.

// Non-throwing for all four modeled conditions (accepted / plan-missing /
// plan-unapproved / plan-stale).
